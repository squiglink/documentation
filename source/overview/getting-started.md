# Getting started

Squiglink is an audio measurement database powered by creators (squigglers). We provide frequency response measurements for thousands of IEMs, headphones, wireless products, and more.

## Joining Squiglink

### Official

If you're an audio reviewer, collector, or a company with a passion for making meticulous measurements of IEMs or headphones, contact us to launch a Squiglink database and learn more:

### Self-hosted

It is possible to self-host if you are not willing to be a part of the official instance. Squiglink consists of multiple monolithic services:

- [API](https://github.com/squiglink/api) - the JSON API for developers.
- [Lab](https://github.com/squiglink/lab) - the user-facing website.
- [Studio](https://github.com/squiglink/studio) - the website for squigglers.

You would typically want to host all of these, but it is possible to, for example, omit Lab if you are planning on building your own public interface.

> [!warning]
> The API and Studio are currently under development and are not yet ready for public use, unless you are willing to report bugs and collaborate.

## Contributing

The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/squiglink) under the permissive [BSD Zero Clause License](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/0bsd/). Small and big contributions are welcome alike.

In addition, we are currently considering the possibility of signing commercial contracts to support development.
